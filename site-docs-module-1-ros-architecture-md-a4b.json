  "description": "Understanding the underlying architecture of ROS 2 is crucial for designing, developing, and debugging complex robotic systems. ROS 2 is designed to be a flexible, distributed middleware that facilitates communication between various software components (nodes) running on potentially different machines. This chapter will explore the core components of the ROS 2 architecture and how they enable powerful robotic applications.",
