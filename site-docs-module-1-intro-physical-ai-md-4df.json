  "description": "The field of artificial intelligence has made tremendous strides in recent years, moving beyond purely digital realms to interact with and manipulate the physical world. This burgeoning area, often termed \"Physical AI\" or \"Embodied AI,\" is fundamentally about creating intelligent systems that can perceive, reason, plan, and act within the physical environment. Humanoid robots, with their potential to emulate human capabilities, stand at the forefront of this revolution. This chapter lays the groundwork for understanding Physical AI, its core concepts, and its critical role in developing intelligent embodied agents.",
