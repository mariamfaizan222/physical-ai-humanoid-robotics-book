  "description": "The ultimate goal of Physical AI and VLA systems is to enable robots to act effectively in the physical world. Action generation is the process by which a robot translates high-level goals, perceptions, and linguistic commands into a sequence of physical movements and interactions. This chapter delves into the principles and techniques behind generating and controlling robot actions, focusing on how embodied AI systems can achieve goal-directed behavior.",
